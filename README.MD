# Welcome!

This is my C repo which I use to document my progress while I teach myself the C Programming Language!

My learning resources:

1. "The C Programming Language", 2nd Edition by Brian W. Kernighan and Dennis M. Richie

2. Project-Based-Tutorials-in-C by @chesal from: https://github.com/chesal/Project-Based-Tutorials-in-C
